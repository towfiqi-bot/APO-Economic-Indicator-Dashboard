2) Best way to request new features without starting from scratch? And what if CSV Data_Master adds new columns?
Best way to request changes (so we don’t restart)

Do this each time:

Upload the current working files (the exact ones deployed):
index.html, admin.html, styles.css, app.js, data.js (+ any new assets)

Tell me:

What to change (exact behavior + where)

What must not change (e.g., “no hardcoded numbers,” “keep layout,” “don’t touch data.js schema”)

Any new screenshots (if layout/UI changes)

This guarantees continuity and prevents “start from scratch.”

If Data_Master CSV gets new columns

You have two cases:

Case A — You just want the new column available (data-only)

Upload CSV in admin.html → the code already auto-detects new numeric columns and adds them to the indicator list with label = column name.

No JSON needed.

This is the fastest path.

Case B — You want the new column to look “nice” (proper label, unit, projection pair, formatting)
Then create/update the indicator labels JSON (recommended for polished output).
You would add an entry like:

{
  "id": "New_Column_Name",
  "label": "Nice indicator title",
  "unit": "Percent",
  "fmt": "0.0",
  "proj": "New_Column_Name_proj_2530_pct"
}


Rule of thumb

Add columns freely in Data_Master → they will show up automatically.

Use JSON only when you want:

human-friendly label

Data vs Projection pairing (proj)

consistent units/formatting
